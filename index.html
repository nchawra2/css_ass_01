    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.</li>
      <li>
        CSS describe how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper or in
        other media.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strike>Css is not necessary</strike> <mark><b>CSS saves a lot of time.</b></mark> It can control the layout
        of multiple webpage all at once
      </li>
      <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="ul-2">
      <li>Inline - by using style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
      <li>Internal - by using style elememnt in head section</li>
      <li>
        External - by using link element to link to an external CSS file.
        However <mark><b>in this tutorial we will use internal and inline styles,</b></mark> because
        this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
      should be applied.
